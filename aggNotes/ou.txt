* **High-powered offense:** Averaged 35.5 points per game in 2023, ranked 3rd nationally.
* **Talented running back:** Gavin Sawchuk rushed for over 600 yards and 7 touchdowns.
* **Experienced quarterback:** Casey Thompson, a transfer from Texas, has 30 career starts.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Inexperience on offensive line:** Lost 6 starters from the 2023 season.
* **Struggling defense:** Allowed 23.5 points per game in 2023, ranked 46th nationally.
* **Tough schedule:** Joining the SEC in 2023, will face 6 additional Power 5 opponents.

**Underrated Player:** Steel Roberts (TE, transfer from Baylor)
**Breakout Player:** DeSean McCullough (LB, transfer from Indiana)

**2024 Projected Win Total:** 9

**Thoughts:** Oklahoma faces a major challenge in their first season in the SEC. The Sooners have a talented offense, but must improve their defense and offensive line to compete with the league's top teams. The schedule is brutal, with road games at Alabama and LSU. A 9-3 record is a realistic projection, with a chance at 10-2 if they can upset one of the SEC powerhouses.
