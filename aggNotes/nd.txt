Summer School

**Strengths:**

* Improved wide receiver unit with three graduate transfers and a highly-rated early enrollee
* Returning Bronco Nagurski award winner at safety (Xavier Watts)
* Experienced defense with seven graduate students
* Athletic quarterback Riley Leonard with both passing and running ability
* Talented young players at linebacker and other positions

**Weaknesses / Concerns:**

* Offensive line could be a downgrade from last year with the loss of left tackle Joe Alt
* Inexperienced linebackers replacing key starters
* Depth at wide receiver beyond the top seven is a question mark
* Quarterback Riley Leonard needs to improve his accuracy

**Underrated Player:**

* Jordan Faison (Wide Receiver): A preferred walk-on lacrosse player who became a key contributor as a freshman and has continued to impress in the spring.

**Breakout Player:**

* Christian Gray (Cornerback): A sophomore who is expected to start opposite Benjamin Morrison and has the potential to be a standout player.

**Upgraded Positions:**

* Wide receiver
* Defense as a whole

**Downgraded Positions:**

* Offensive line
