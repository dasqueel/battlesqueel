Bama transfers and Denver Harris

The G5 Hive Worker Bee Series 2024 - UTSA Roadrunners

**Strengths:**

* Experienced and talented offensive line, led by Bentley Tatafou, Luke Lopezzi, and Corey Godnett.
* Strong running back corps with proven performers Kavorian Barnes, Robert Henry, and Rocco Griffin.
* Promising wide receiver in Devin McEwen, who emerged as a reliable target in 2023.

**Weaknesses/Concerns:**

* Turnover at quarterback following the departure of Frank Harris.
* Uncertainty in the cornerback position following the loss of several key players to graduation and the transfer portal.
* Lack of proven leadership in the absence of previous leaders Frank Harris and Rashad Wisdom.

**Underrated Players:**

* Devin Amador (WR) - Flashed potential as a freshman and could assume a larger role in 2024.
* Brandon Brown (DL) - Solid nose tackle who has consistently contributed for the Roadrunners.
* Jamorian Robinson (LB) - Strong pass rusher who could step into a more prominent role with the departure of Trey Moore.

**Breakout Players:**

* Owen McCown (QB) - Transfer from Colorado, projected starter with technical skills and potential to open up the offense.
* JJ Sparkman (WR) - Transfer from TCU, expected to provide a different profile in the receiving corps with his size.

**Upgraded/Downgraded Position Groups:**

* **Upgraded:** Running back - Depth and experience increase stability
* **Downgraded:** Cornerback - Loss of key players creates uncertainty and need for new starters

**Additional Notes:**

* Co-offensive coordinator Will Stein takes over as the primary play-caller with Harris' departure.
* New transfers, including Demetrius Davis (QB), Bryson Donnell (RB), and Frankie Arthur (RB), add options to the roster but remain relatively unproven.
* The coaching staff faced high demand due to the team's success, leading to the departure of several assistants to other programs.
* Despite these challenges, head coach Jeff Traylor maintains a strong brand and fan support, which helps mitigate concerns about leadership and other transitions.

**Success Metrics for 2024 Season:**

* Win total exceeding 8.5 (the over/under set by Vegas)
* Contending for the American Athletic Conference (AAC) championship
* Maintaining or improving team culture and leadership in the absence of key players from previous seasons.
