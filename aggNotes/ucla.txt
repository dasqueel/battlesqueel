A Deep Dive Into the 2024 UCLA Bruins

**Strengths**

* Wide receiver depth
* Ethan Garbers (quarterback) - potential strength after last year's performances
* Jay Toia (defensive tackle) - major addition
* Tight end position

**Weaknesses / Concerns**

* Offensive line depth, especially on the left side and at center
* Defensive coordinator change - uncertainty about new coach's impact
* Defensive end - inexperienced group
* Strength of schedule - difficult stretch of games against LSU, Oregon, and Penn State

**X-Factor**

* Offensive line - if they can maintain last year's performance, they can support the offense

**Underrated Players**

* Keegan Jones (running back) - potential to produce more in Steele's absence
* Logan Loya (wide receiver) - reliable pass catcher
* Keanu Williams and David Magna (defensive tackles) - depth behind Toia and Smith

**Breakout Players**

* T.J. Harden (running back) - could emerge as the lead back
* Regal Flores (wide receiver) - expected to make an impact after transferring from Notre Dame
* Mony Malafou (defensive end) - explosive on the edge and could team up with Musa to disrupt offenses
